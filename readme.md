# Chuck Norris Forever

## Welcome on our Readme !

We have done this work for a team project exercise for *Becode*.

The purpose of the exercise : create a character manager in Javascript.
We work with HTML, CSS, Javasript, Tailwind, Git, Github and Netlify.

We deploy the website on Netlify : https://merry-zuccutto-98be9a.netlify.app/index.html


Objectives
- Use best JS practices
- Read documentation and test a REST API
- Use a REST API with HTTP requests
- Create a typical asynchronous flow : send asynchronous (promises or async/await) requests to a remote server and process the results
- DOM manipulation: changing the DOM based on results of HTTP requests
